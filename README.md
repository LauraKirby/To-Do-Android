## To Do List for Android
-----------

### A user can:
1. enter new items
2. invoke a "long click" to delete an item
3. invoke a (short) "click" to edit an item.
 - when a short click occurs on a listview item, the text becomes editable in the edit text field. Simultaneously, the "Add Item" button text changes to "Update."
