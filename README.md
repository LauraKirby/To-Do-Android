**To Do Android** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Laura Kirby**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.

* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

## Notes

Android Studio is pretty neat! I like how many of the Android method and selector names are similar to those used within web development. The code editor is helpful, I like how the warnings allow you to quickly try several things.

When following the slides for the To Do app, I became confused at slide 19. I was coding along and didn't realize that only some of the code pictured in the slide was to be included in `MainActivity.java`. When I reached out to Nathan, he was quick to respond (thank you).

I didn't realize that there was a coding aspect of the application, I would have made time for it earlier in the month. My fault for not checking my email more regularly.

Thank you for considering my candidacy!
